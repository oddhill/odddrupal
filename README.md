# Drupal, by Odd Hill AB

Complete Drupal package that contains custom installation profiles that are used by [Odd Hill](http://www.oddhill.se/).

We won't keep this README updated with the detailed contents of each profile since its too much work to maintain. Instead, feel free to download and investigate for yourself, fork and modify for your needs, or simply be inspired.

## Odd Drupal

The main installation profile that contains the most basic modules that are used for every site, and various helper functionality such as default views for the content administration page.

## Odd Vault
Installation profile that extends Odd Drupal but adds a more "locked" expirence, which is suitable for sites that require a login, such as intranets.
